# milwaukee_voting
 voting simulator based on data from https://county.milwaukee.gov/EN/County-Clerk/Off-Nav/Election-Results/Election-Results-Fall-2020  There are accusations that the voting pattern is suspicious in that it violates Benford's Law. It appears that this data set is invalid for Benford's Law, as the leading digit in each voting ward is not equally likely.  The voting wards in Milwaukee were probably designed to have roughly the same number of people. If there are 1000 people in a ward, and one candidate has 70% support, it would stand to reason that the leading digit of 4,5,6,7 are higher than normal, while the candidate with 3% support has a distribution that more closely matches Benford's Law.
